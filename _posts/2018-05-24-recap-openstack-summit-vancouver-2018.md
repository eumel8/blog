<p>in my last vacation I spent most of the time to visit the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver. It's my 4th Summit and it's one of the best Summit. The bar is very high vor the upcoming event in Berlin.</p>
<p>[teaserbreak]<br />I was never been before in Canada and Vancouver is really a beautiful town. "The City of Glass" is another name for the city because of the countless buildings with a glass front, near the ocean with high mountains as background covered with ice.</p>

<p><br />The roons in the venue are also mostly a little bit too cold, but outside are temperatures around 20 degrees and we experienced two days full of sun without clouds.</p>
<p>[image:280]</p>
<p>That brings me to my first topic. There is no OpenStack Summit anymore where only sessions for the cloud computing software are covered. It's branded in the heads of the people: There are a conference with countless presentations, you are sitting in lighless rooms the whole day to consum power point slides. That's definitely not the case. From my feeling I met about 100 people in sessions, on the floors, mostly spontaneous, or during the lunch breaks.</p>
<p>[image:258]</p>
<p>I participated sessions where things discussed like DevOps or CI/CD systems in Enterprise environments. I learned in a workshop to install Zuul, the gate check system in the CI/CD environment of the OpenStack developement. This system is usable outside the OpenStack community at http://openlabtesting.org/. Latest on this point do you notice: you have leaved the OpenStack country. Behind that services are mostly OpenStack running, but now since OpenStack is grown up we are dealing with use cases more than before.</p>
<p>[image:274]</p>
<p>Like the Edge Computing Day. It's a brand new technology and the OpenStack Summit covered the topic on a full day. There are really interesting presentations like Swisscom TV, where Edge Computing is already there. RedHat shows OpenStack in a box for training, militaries or computer for the space (curiously OpenStack was initially developed by NASA). There are research presentation about Edge Computing standards with a smooth invitation to join the adventure. That are really pioneers.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are common sessions like our <a href="https://www.openstack.org/videos/vancouver-2018/docsi18n-project-update">OpenStack I18n project update</a> or a day before the project onboarding session to explain people what we are doing and answer questions. Traditionally our own project update session is mostly empty in the audience, but it's professional recorded and our worldwide spreaded team can watch it on Youtube. And I saw project update sessions from the OpenStack Ansible team with a really packed room. It's a good heart rate monitor where stands the team and what are the highlights or the issues in the past release cycle.</p>

<p>At the end of the week you have visited at least 3 conferences: The OpenStack Summit as Open Infrastructure event, The Edge Cumputing Day with topics around Edge and 5G. TheÂ <a href="http://www.opendevconf.com/">OpenDev Conf</a> with his own keynote track and a lots of collaborate discussions.<br />If this is not enough; There are several intensive trainings before and during the summit. Traditionally the Upstream Institut starts the weekend before the summit. Or you can get 2 days intensive trainings, i.e. Preparing for the Certified OpenStack Administrator exam - for free!<br />This is a lived diversity of a global community.</p>
