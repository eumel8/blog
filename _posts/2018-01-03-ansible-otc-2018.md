<p>After another year with work and usage of Ansible-OTC I want to share a project update and the vision for 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Role collection. </strong>There are a lots of roles in the <a href="https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>. This is good to show the work of OTC-API and for demonstration, but bad for overview and automation. I tried to collect functions following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a> standard into new roles. I.e. otc_ecs should Create, Read, Update, and Delete ECS resources on OTC: <a title="https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/tree/dev/roles/otc_ecs" href="https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/tree/dev/roles/otc_ecs" target="_blank">https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/tree/dev/roles/otc_ecs</a></li>
<li><strong>Input-Handler. </strong>It was a good idea to use ini-files for configuration items, because it's good readable and easy to unterstand. Previously I used yml-files for the same function, other projects are using json.  To split this function more from the Ansible roles I created different handlers for ini, yml and json, so the customer can choice: <a class="" title="https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/tree/dev/playbooks/vars" href="https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/tree/dev/playbooks/vars">https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/tree/dev/playbooks/vars</a></li>
<li><strong>Testing. </strong>Ansible developement goes really fast, so <a href="https://github.com/eumel8/ansible-otc/issues/13" target="_blank">code can sometimes break</a> because things aren't working anymore in newer versions of Ansible or Python. I started to play with Travis and included some functional tests: <a class="" title="https://travis-ci.org/eumel8/ansible-otc" href="https://travis-ci.org/eumel8/ansible-otc">https://travis-ci.org/eumel8/ansible-otc</a></li>
<li><strong>Documentation. </strong>There are multiple Markdown files for use cases and role description. I switched to Sphinx, which is more portable and documentation is nearly to the code like the role documentation. A published version is on <a class="" title="http://ansible-otc.readthedocs.io/en/dev/?badge=latest" href="http://ansible-otc.readthedocs.io/en/dev/?badge=latest">http://ansible-otc.readthedocs.io/en/dev/?badge=latest</a></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see the next release<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"> of Ansible-OTC will contain a lot of changes, so it will be easier to use OTC with Ansible.</span></p>
