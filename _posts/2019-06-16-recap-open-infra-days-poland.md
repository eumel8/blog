Open Infra Days Krakow 2019

Each year in June the team from Compendium Education Center is organizing a community event in Krakow, Poland. The Special in this year: the first event under the new name Open Infra Days Krakow.

<br/>
Roughly 200 people boarded Forum Wydarzen directly on the river Vistula for the 2-day event with 3 session streams. In the workshop stream the attendees played the Phoenix Project Game, a business simulation around DevOps and Agile Work.
The Keynotes are held by <strong>Thierry Carrez</strong>, VP of Engineering at OpenStack Foundation and <strong>Simon Briggs</strong>, Senior Solutions Architect for Cloud at SUSE, which was also one of the main sponsors for the event. Both talked about Open Developement and Open Source. Thierry underlined the importance of integration as the last mile. Simon circled back 65 Mio years in this history of the SUSE mascot chameleon as lion and innovator.

The right title for his session: evolve or die.
The breakout session are mixed up in polish and english language, slides are mostly in english and shared on different platforms. Stream 2 started after a break with <strong>Dr Kenneth Tan </strong>from Sardina Systems. “Be ready for OpenStack and Kubernetes highly efficient while optimizing your resource management”. A very deep structured talk about the business view of OpenStack and Kubernetes operations, cost avoidance and optimization.
Are your containers secure? <strong>Michał Gutowsk</strong>i from OracleOpen Cloud Infrastructure was asking in his talk. He touched several point about risks, e.g download containers from unknown source or unknown installation. Very practical stuff with many advises.

After the lunch break with good food, drinks and talks a full block of NFV sessions were served. All of them are based on OpenStack and in demo session attendees could see the powerness of virtual networks. 
At the end of day 1, <strong>Frank Kloeker</strong>, Technology Manager Cloud Applications at Deutsche Telekom circled back to the Open Source topic from the Keynote sessions in the morning and showed some <a href="https://slides.com/frankkloeker/openinfra-days-2019#/">use cases to adapt working methods from the OpenStack community for your own work.</a>
Next on the agenda in the evening was the party, started on a boat at the foot of the castle Wawel with the fire-breathing dragon:

But that was only the starting point. The attendees have to solve some riddles and puzzles to reach the next station of the party, another pub with another riddle. A really funny event with lots of conversations because the description was mostly in Polish.
After this hot evening (there about 35 degrees this week in Krakow), day 2 started at Forum Wydarzen.
“Beyond the hype: the real promise of AI” was the first talk in the morning by Kaimar Karu at MIndbridge. A very good overview about the status of AI and how about the future.
After that, <strong>Szymon Datko</strong> at OVH, another event sponsor, was talking about Zuul. The session was held in Polish and a lots of people are interested in Zuul, the gate automation system, which were also pretty new for the audience.
